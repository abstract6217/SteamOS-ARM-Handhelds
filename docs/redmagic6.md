# REDMAGIC 6 (Snapdragon 888 / SM8350)

Experimental port to the REDMAGIC 6 (Nubia NX669J), built for the North
American / global model (NX669J-UN firmware). It is a phone, not a handheld
like the other devices here, so a few things work differently:

- **No SD card slot.** SteamOS replaces Android on the internal storage (the
  `userdata` partition). Installing it erases the phone.
- **Nubia's own bootloader** (unlocked) boots it from the `boot` and
  `vendor_boot` partitions. There is no ROCKNIX ABL and no device menu.
- **No built-in gamepad.** Use a Bluetooth or USB controller. The capacitive
  shoulder triggers show up as their own input devices (4 zones).
- **No release image.** Nubia's firmware cannot be redistributed, so you
  build the kit yourself from Nubia's OTA and a SteamOS ARM release (below).

> [!WARNING]
> Tested on one NX669J-UN only. Game Mode, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth pads, speakers,
> sleep and charging work there, but expect rough edges.

## Build

Everything here runs on an x86_64 or arm64 Linux PC with ~40 GB free on a
Linux filesystem. You need the stock firmware zip for your phone
(`NX669J-update.zip`, Nubia's full OTA for the NX669J-UN).

```bash
export STEAMOS_WORK=/work

# 1. Firmware (DSPs, GPU zap, Wi-Fi/BT, RGB effects) + stock vbmeta/boot/dtbo images
scripts/extract-nx669j-firmware.sh NX669J-update.zip

# 2. Kernel: mainline 7.1.2 + external-and-mods/kernel-sm8350/patches
#    (cross-compiles on x86: aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc)
external-and-mods/kernel-sm8350/build.sh

# 3. The kit, from a release's rootfs (it is the same on every chip)
./make-steamos-sm8350.sh --from-img steamos-arm-handhelds-v1.2.img
```

Instead of a release, step 3 can take the rootfs `make-steamos-sm8650.sh`
built (`./make-steamos-sm8350.sh`, default `$STEAMOS_WORK/rootfs`, see
[building.md](building.md)). Either way the source is copied to
`$STEAMOS_WORK/rootfs-sm8350` first and never changed.

The kit lands in `$STEAMOS_WORK/steamos-sm8350-redmagic6/`: `boot.img`,
`vendor_boot.img`, `vendor_boot-debug.img`, `userdata.img`, `vbmeta.img` and
the flash scripts.

## 1. Test boot

Power off, hold **Volume Down + Power** until the fastboot screen, connect USB.

Nubia's bootloader does not start images sent with `fastboot boot` (it
answers OKAY and stays in fastboot), and it only boots its own layout: the
kernel in `boot`, the devicetree and initramfs in `vendor_boot`. So the test
uses slot b and leaves `userdata` alone:

```bash
fastboot flash vbmeta_b vbmeta.img          # verification off (kit's copy)
fastboot erase dtbo_b                       # no overlays: they break a mainline DTB
fastboot flash boot_b boot.img
fastboot flash vendor_boot_b vendor_boot-debug.img
fastboot --set-active=b
fastboot reboot
```

If it comes straight back to fastboot (about 15 s), the bootloader refused
the image. `vendor_boot-debug.img` boots with a verbose console and, when it
finds no SteamOS on `userdata` (expected on this first try), opens a debug
shell over USB:

- a serial port (`/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux, a COM port on Windows): e.g.
  `screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200` or PuTTY
- a USB network interface: set the PC side to `172.16.42.2/24`, then
  `telnet 172.16.42.1`

In there, `dmesg` shows what came up. Useful checks:

```sh
cat /proc/cmdline | tr ' ' '\n' | grep msm_drm   # which panel ABL found
ls /sys/class/block/ | grep sd                    # UFS LUNs
```

Please send that log (or open an issue with it) if something is off. Back to
Android from here: `fastboot --set-active=a` (slot a was not touched).

## 2. Install

This erases Android and everything on the phone.

```bash
./flash-redmagic6.sh              # Linux / macOS
flash-redmagic6.bat               # Windows
```

It flashes `vbmeta` with verification off, erases `dtbo`, writes `boot.img`
and `vendor_boot.img` to both slots and `userdata.img` to `userdata`, then
reboots. The first boot takes a few minutes while the filesystem grows to the
whole partition. Boot logs go to `/var/log/steamos-arm-boot/`, and
`vendor_boot-debug.img` in place of `vendor_boot.img` gives the USB shell
again.

## Back to Android

Flash Nubia's full OTA from the recovery or with a tool that writes all
partitions from `payload.bin`, or put the stock images back from
`$STEAMOS_WORK/nx669j-firmware.stock/`:

```bash
fastboot flash boot_a boot.img && fastboot flash boot_b boot.img
fastboot flash vendor_boot_a vendor_boot.img && fastboot flash vendor_boot_b vendor_boot.img
fastboot flash dtbo_a dtbo.img && fastboot flash dtbo_b dtbo.img
fastboot flash vbmeta_a vbmeta.img && fastboot flash vbmeta_b vbmeta.img
fastboot -w                      # userdata back to empty, Android formats it
```

The `system`/`vendor` partitions are never touched by this port, so that is
enough if Android was installed before.

## How it works

- **Kernel** (`external-and-mods/kernel-sm8350/`): mainline Linux 7.1.2 on the
  arm64 defconfig. The patches add the NX669J devicetree and the drivers the
  phone needs that mainline lacks: the AMOLED panels, the fan MCU, the RGB
  light, the shoulder triggers, the MAX98937 amps and GT9897 touch over I2C.
  Values come from Nubia's stock DT and kernel source
  ([ztemt/NX669J-kernel](https://github.com/ztemt/NX669J-kernel));
  `tools/gen-panel-seq.py` turns the panel init sequences from the stock dtbo
  into C tables. The DT also carries the CPU capacities and energy model from
  the stock DTB (`sm8350.dtsi` has none), so the scheduler knows the X1 and
  A78s from the A55s. The GPU, thermal and UFS fixes the 8 Gen 2 and 8 Elite
  kernels carry apply here too (game queues no longer starve Steam's UI, the
  GMU drops its power votes when the GPU idles).
- **Battery**: the ADSP firmware never sends its battery info, misreports
  `power_now` and says Charging on any charger, even one too weak for the
  load. A `qcom_battmgr` patch reports the charge in mAh with `charge_now`, a
  steady discharge current from the firmware's own averaged time to empty,
  `power_now` as voltage × current, and Discharging on a net drain, so
  UPower and Steam can work out the time left.
- **Boot**: Nubia's layout (`mkbootimg-v3.py`): the kernel in a v3 `boot`,
  the DTB, initramfs and cmdline in a v3 `vendor_boot`. With a valid `dtbo`
  the ABL overlays Nubia's board dtbo and the Haven hypervisor's overlays onto
  the DTB (libufdt), which fails on a mainline tree, so `dtbo` is erased; the
  ABL then matches the DTB by msm-id and the board's (unpublished) board-id,
  hence one DTB copy per board-id of the stock dtbo (`soc.env` BOARD_IDS).
  The busybox initramfs is shared with the other chips and mounts
  `PARTLABEL=userdata` (`steamos.root=`, because ABL appends its own `root=`).
- **Display**: 144/120/90/60 Hz are separate modes with their own init
  sequences (command-mode panel), so changing the rate is a full modeset.
  The panel is portrait; the DT `rotation = <270>` makes gamescope run Game
  Mode in landscape, like on the Steam Deck.
- **Userspace**: the shared rootfs plus `sm8350-overlay`
  (`scripts/apply-overlays-sm8350.sh`); the shared scripts that know about
  the phone match the DT model "REDMAGIC 6". On a release rootfs the script
  also brings in the later shared fixes that apply to the phone (Decky
  v3.2.10, Handheld Control, the focus fix for minimised games, no Steam
  Frame VR layers, Windows games can't change the device volume), and the
  overlay has the 8 Gen 2 image's tuning: services on all eight cores, zstd
  zram sized to RAM, the TEO cpuidle governor, no systemd tag on backlight
  events.
